Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a practice that treats infrastructure components such as virtual machines, network devices, and software as code. This means that infrastructure is defined and managed through code, rather than through manual processes.  

I have been using Terraform at my new job for a few months now and there are several benefits to using IaC:
1. Version control: IaC allows you to store your infrastructure configuration in a version control system, such as Git. This makes it easier to track changes, revert back to previous versions, and collaborate with others.
2. Reusability: IaC makes it easy to reuse infrastructure configurations, which can save time and reduce errors when setting up new environments or making changes to existing ones.
3. Maintainability: IaC makes it easy to maintain infrastructure, as you can use scripts and tools to automate tasks such as provisioning, configuration, and deployment.
4. Documentation: IaC serves as documentation for your infrastructure, as the code reflects the current state of your infrastructure.
5. Repeatability: IaC makes it easy to create identical copies of your infrastructure, which is useful for testing and disaster recovery.
6. Reliability: Using IaC can help reduce errors and improve reliability, as you can use automated testing to ensure that your infrastructure is configured correctly.  

Overall, IaC can help improve the efficiency, speed, and reliability of infrastructure management, making it an attractive option for many organizations.
