Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are software engineering practices that aim to minimize the time taken between writing code and deploying it to production.
Continuous Integration involves regularly integrating code changes into a central repository, and then automatically building and testing the code to ensure that it works as intended. This helps to catch errors and bugs early in the development process, and makes it easier to identify and fix problems.  

Continuous Delivery builds on Continuous Integration by automating the process of releasing code changes to production. This involves creating a repeatable and reliable process for deploying code changes, which may include activities such as testing, staging, and releasing. The goal of Continuous Delivery is to be able to release code changes to production at any time, with confidence that they will work as intended.  

Together, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery can help organizations to deliver code changes to customers more quickly and with fewer errors, improving the efficiency and reliability of the software development process.
