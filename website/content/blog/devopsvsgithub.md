Azure DevOps and GitHub are both tools for hosting and managing code repositories, as well as for automating the build, test, and deployment process. However, there are some key differences between the two:  

- Platform: Azure DevOps is a Microsoft product, while GitHub is owned by Microsoft but was originally developed as an independent company. As a result, Azure DevOps is more tightly integrated with other Microsoft tools and services, such as Visual Studio and Azure, while GitHub has a more open ecosystem with a larger number of integrations.
- Features: Azure DevOps and GitHub both offer a range of tools for hosting and managing code repositories, as well as for automating the build, test, and deployment process. However, Azure DevOps includes a wider range of features, including agile project management, testing, and release management tools, while GitHub is more focused on source control and collaboration.
- Pricing: Azure DevOps and GitHub have different pricing models. Azure DevOps is a paid service, with different pricing plans based on the features and number of users you need. GitHub also has a paid version, called GitHub Enterprise, but it also offers a free version for open-source projects.  

Overall, the choice between Azure DevOps and GitHub will depend on your specific needs and requirements, as well as on your existing tools and ecosystem.
